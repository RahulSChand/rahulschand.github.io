_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is asking about how to run their index.html project like an npm server. Looking at the attached file, I can see this is a static HTML website - it's a personal portfolio/academic website for Rahul Chand. 

The file is a simple HTML file with Bootstrap CSS, some custom CSS, and JavaScript. It doesn't appear to be a Node.js project that would use npm. It's just a static website.

For running a static HTML file, there are several options:
1. Simply open it in a browser (file:// protocol)
2. Use a simple HTTP server like Python's built-in server, Node.js http-server, or Live Server extension in VS Code
3. Use npm's http-server package if they want something npm-related

Let me check if there are any package.json files or other Node.js related files in the directory to see if this is actually meant to be an npm project.</details></think>

Looking at your `index.html` file, this appears to be a static website (personal portfolio) rather than a Node.js project. However, there are several ways you can serve it locally:

I can see this is a static HTML website without any Node.js project files (no `package.json`). Here are several ways you can run this locally:

## Option 1: Using npm's http-server (npm-based solution)
```bash
# Install http-server globally
npm install -g http-server

# Run from your project directory
http-server

# Or specify port
http-server -p 3000
```

## Option 2: Using Python's built-in server (if you have Python)
```bash
# Python 3
python -m http.server 8000

# Python 2
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
```

## Option 3: Using Node.js http-server without global install
```bash
# Run directly with npx (no installation needed)
npx http-server

# With specific port
npx http-server -p 3000
```

## Option 4: Using Live Server (if you have VS Code)
- Install the "Live Server" extension in VS Code
- Right-click on `index.html` and select "Open with Live Server"

## Option 5: Simple browser opening
You can also just double-click the `index.html` file to open it directly in your browser, though this uses the `file://` protocol which may have some limitations with certain features.

**Recommendation**: Use **Option 3** (`npx http-server`) as it's npm-related, doesn't require global installation, and works great for static sites. After running it, you can access your site at `http://localhost:8080` (or whatever port it shows in the terminal).
