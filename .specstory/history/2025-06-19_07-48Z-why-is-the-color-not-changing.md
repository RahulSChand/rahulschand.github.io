# Why is the color not changing? (2025-06-19 07:48Z)

_**User**_

in my current file I see this thing where no matter what color I mention in the <span class> stanford it never changes the color why?

---

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is asking about why their color styling for the "Stanford" text in their HTML file isn't working. Let me look at the specific line they're referring to.

Looking at line 126 in the file:
```html
Hi ü§ù I am Rahul, I am currently a grad student at <span class="text-red-700">Stanford</span> üå≤ and an intern at NVIDIA Research working on post-training for Nemotron LLMs.
```

The user has `<span class="text-red-700">Stanford</span>` but says the color isn't changing. This suggests that the CSS class `text-red-700` isn't being applied or isn't working as expected.

Looking at the HTML structure, I can see they're using Bootstrap 4.4.1 and also have a custom CSS file `assets/style-3.css`. The class `text-red-700` looks like it might be a Tailwind CSS class, but I don't see Tailwind CSS being loaded in the HTML.

Let me check the CSS file to see what styles are being applied and whether there might be any conflicts or if the class is defined there.</details></think>

---

I can see the issue! Looking at your HTML file, you're using the class `text-red-700` on the Stanford span, but this appears to be a Tailwind CSS class. However, I don't see Tailwind CSS being loaded in your HTML file.

Let me check your CSS file to see what styles are available:

---

Read file: assets/style-3.css

---

Now I can see the problem! Your CSS file doesn't contain any definition for the `text-red-700` class. This is a Tailwind CSS class, but you're not using Tailwind in your project. You're using Bootstrap 4.4.1, which has different color utility classes.

Here are your options to fix this:

**Option 1: Use Bootstrap color classes**
Replace `text-red-700` with Bootstrap's built-in text color classes:
```html
<span class="text-danger">Stanford</span>
```
Or for different red shades available in Bootstrap 4:
- `text-danger` (standard Bootstrap red)

**Option 2: Add a custom CSS class**
Add this to your `assets/style-3.css` file:
```css
.text-red-700 {
    color: #b91c1c; /* This is the equivalent of Tailwind's red-700 */
}
```

**Option 3: Use inline styles**
```html
<span style="color: #b91c1c;">Stanford</span>
```

I'd recommend **Option 1** since you're already using Bootstrap and it keeps things consistent. Just change line 126 from:
```html
<span class="text-red-700">Stanford</span>
```
to:
```html
<span class="text-danger">Stanford</span>
```

The reason your color wasn't changing is because the CSS class `text-red-700` simply doesn't exist in any of the stylesheets you've loaded (Bootstrap or your custom CSS file).

_**User**_

ok so I put it in the .css and it worked 

I want the following 

1) color code that is closest to the red color of Stanford 
2) Make the font just slightly bigger like by just 

How do I accomplish this

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user wants to:
1. Use the actual Stanford red color code
2. Make the font slightly bigger

I need to:
1. Find the official Stanford red color code
2. Show how to modify the CSS to include both the color and font size increase

Let me search for Stanford's official brand colors first.</details></think>

Perfect! I found the official Stanford Cardinal red color code. According to Stanford's official identity guide, the authentic Cardinal red color is:

**HEX: #8C1515**

Now I'll show you how to update your CSS to use the official Stanford red and make the font slightly bigger:

```css:assets/style-3.css
.text-red-700 {
    color: #8C1515; /* Official Stanford Cardinal Red */
    font-size: 1.05em; /* Makes font 5% bigger than normal */
}
```

Here's what each part does:

1. **Color code `#8C1515`**: This is Stanford's official Cardinal red from their brand guidelines (RGB: 140, 21, 21)
2. **Font size `1.05em`**: This makes the text 5% larger than the surrounding text. You can adjust this:
   - `1.1em` = 10% bigger
   - `1.15em` = 15% bigger  
   - `1.02em` = just 2% bigger (very subtle)

The `em` unit is relative to the parent element's font size, so it will scale proportionally with the rest of your text.

If you want it even more subtle, you could also try:
```css
.text-red-700 {
    color: #8C1515;
    font-size: 1.02em; /* Just 2% bigger - very subtle */
    font-weight: 500; /* Slightly bolder font weight instead of/in addition to size */
}
```

This will give you the authentic Stanford red color that matches their official branding, plus a subtle size increase that draws attention without being too prominent.

_**User**_

ok what way can I slightly color the terms "NVIDIA" and "Microsoft Research" in there logo colors u feel me? Like what options do I have that they are not too loud and just have some diff that makes it look cool

---

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Looking at the current HTML, I can see that the user has:
1. "Stanford" with the class "text-red-700" which we just set up with Stanford's official red
2. "NVIDIA Research" - they want to add NVIDIA's brand color
3. "Microsoft Research" - they want to add Microsoft's brand color

I can see they already have a Microsoft icon with color #00BCF2, and there's an incomplete NVIDIA icon with color #76B900.

For styling options, they want something subtle that looks cool but not too loud. Here are some options:

1. **Subtle color with same font weight** - just change the color slightly
2. **Subtle color with slight font weight increase** - make it slightly bolder
3. **Subtle color with very slight size increase** - like we did with Stanford
4. **Gradient or hover effects** - more dynamic
5. **Background highlighting** - subtle background color
6. **Border/underline effects** - subtle accent

For brand colors:
- NVIDIA: Their primary green is typically #76B900 (which is already in the HTML) or #00D4AA (their newer green)
- Microsoft: Their blue is #00BCF2 (already in the HTML) or their newer #0078D4

I should suggest a few different approaches with varying levels of subtlety.</details></think>

---

Great idea! I can see you already have the NVIDIA and Microsoft colors partially set up. Let me give you several styling options from most subtle to slightly more prominent:

Perfect! Now I have both official brand colors. Here are your styling options from subtle to slightly more prominent:

## Brand Colors:
- **NVIDIA Green**: `#76B900` (official)
- **Microsoft Blue**: `#00BCF2` (you already have this)

## Option 1: Most Subtle - Just Color
```css:assets/style-3.css
.nvidia-text {
    color: #76B900;
}

.microsoft-text {
    color: #00BCF2;
}
```

## Option 2: Subtle + Slight Size
```css:assets/style-3.css
.nvidia-text {
    color: #76B900;
    font-size: 1.02em; /* Just 2% bigger */
}

.microsoft-text {
    color: #00BCF2;
    font-size: 1.02em;
}
```

## Option 3: Color + Subtle Weight
```css:assets/style-3.css
.nvidia-text {
    color: #76B900;
    font-weight: 500; /* Slightly bolder than normal (400) */
}

.microsoft-text {
    color: #00BCF2;
    font-weight: 500;
}
```

## Option 4: My Recommendation - Balanced Cool Effect
```css:assets/style-3.css
.nvidia-text {
    color: #76B900;
    font-size: 1.03em;
    font-weight: 500;
    transition: color 0.2s ease; /* Smooth hover effect */
}

.nvidia-text:hover {
    color: #5a8a00; /* Slightly darker on hover */
}

.microsoft-text {
    color: #00BCF2;
    font-size: 1.03em;
    font-weight: 500;
    transition: color 0.2s ease;
}

.microsoft-text:hover {
    color: #0099cc; /* Slightly darker on hover */
}
```

## HTML Update:
```126:132:index.html
          Hi ü§ù I am Rahul, I am currently a grad student at <span class="text-red-700">Stanford</span> üå≤ and an intern at <span class="nvidia-text">NVIDIA Research</span> working on post-training for Nemotron LLMs. Before this  
          I worked as a Research Fellow at
          <span class="microsoft-text">Microsoft Research</span>
          <i class="fab fa-microsoft" style="color: #00BCF2;"></i>
          with
// ... existing code ...
```

**My recommendation is Option 4** - it gives you:
- Official brand colors for authenticity
- Subtle size increase (3%) for emphasis
- Slightly bolder font weight for presence  
- Smooth hover effects for interactivity
- Not too loud, but definitely noticeable and cool

Which option feels right to you, or would you like me to adjust any of these?

_**User**_

is there a way I can do this cool effect which I have seen in some people's website where if u hover over a link a preview or an img of a small size like 200x200 pops up u get what I am saying

Assume for now I want to have a word which I can hover on and then have an img that will like be shown (and the page which also be there like the current page its not like we will switch)

---

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is asking about a hover effect that shows a preview image when hovering over a link or text. This is commonly called a "tooltip" or "hover preview" effect. They want to show a small image (like 200x200) that appears on hover and disappears when you move away, without navigating away from the current page.

This can be achieved with CSS and HTML using:
1. CSS hover pseudo-class
2. Absolute positioning for the preview
3. CSS transitions for smooth animations
4. Maybe some JavaScript for more advanced features

I should provide a few options from simple CSS-only to more advanced with JavaScript.</details></think>

---

Yes! That's a really cool effect called a "hover preview" or "tooltip with image". It's perfect for showing previews without leaving the page. Here are a few ways to implement it:

## Option 1: Pure CSS - Simple & Clean
```css:assets/style-3.css
.hover-preview {
    position: relative;
    cursor: pointer;
    color: #007bff;
    text-decoration: underline;
    transition: color 0.2s ease;
}

.hover-preview:hover {
    color: #0056b3;
}

.hover-preview .preview-image {
    position: absolute;
    bottom: 100%;
    left: 50%;
    transform: translateX(-50%);
    width: 200px;
    height: 200px;
    object-fit: cover;
    border-radius: 8px;
    box-shadow: 0 8px 25px rgba(0,0,0,0.3);
    opacity: 0;
    visibility: hidden;
    transition: all 0.3s ease;
    z-index: 1000;
    margin-bottom: 10px;
    border: 3px solid white;
}

.hover-preview:hover .preview-image {
    opacity: 1;
    visibility: visible;
    transform: translateX(-50%) translateY(-5px);
}
```

## Option 2: More Advanced with Animation
```css:assets/style-3.css
.hover-preview-advanced {
    position: relative;
    cursor: pointer;
    color: #007bff;
    text-decoration: underline;
    transition: all 0.2s ease;
}

.hover-preview-advanced:hover {
    color: #0056b3;
    text-shadow: 0 0 8px rgba(0,123,255,0.3);
}

.hover-preview-advanced .preview-card {
    position: absolute;
    bottom: 100%;
    left: 50%;
    transform: translateX(-50%) translateY(20px) scale(0.8);
    width: 220px;
    background: white;
    border-radius: 12px;
    box-shadow: 0 15px 35px rgba(0,0,0,0.2);
    opacity: 0;
    visibility: hidden;
    transition: all 0.4s cubic-bezier(0.68, -0.55, 0.265, 1.55);
    z-index: 1000;
    margin-bottom: 15px;
    overflow: hidden;
}

.hover-preview-advanced:hover .preview-card {
    opacity: 1;
    visibility: visible;
    transform: translateX(-50%) translateY(0) scale(1);
}

.hover-preview-advanced .preview-card img {
    width: 100%;
    height: 180px;
    object-fit: cover;
}

.hover-preview-advanced .preview-card .preview-text {
    padding: 10px;
    font-size: 12px;
    color: #666;
    text-align: center;
}
```

## HTML Examples:

**Simple Image Preview:**
```html
<span class="hover-preview">
    Stanford
    <img src="images/stanford-campus.jpg" alt="Stanford Campus" class="preview-image">
</span>
```

**Advanced Card Preview:**
```html
<span class="hover-preview-advanced">
    NVIDIA Research
    <div class="preview-card">
        <img src="images/nvidia-logo.jpg" alt="NVIDIA">
        <div class="preview-text">NVIDIA Research Lab</div>
    </div>
</span>
```

## Option 3: JavaScript-Enhanced (Most Flexible)
```css:assets/style-3.css
.js-hover-preview {
    position: relative;
    cursor: pointer;
    color: #007bff;
    text-decoration: underline;
    transition: color 0.2s ease;
}

.preview-tooltip {
    position: absolute;
    width: 200px;
    height: 200px;
    background: white;
    border-radius: 10px;
    box-shadow: 0 10px 30px rgba(0,0,0,0.3);
    opacity: 0;
    visibility: hidden;
    transition: all 0.3s ease;
    z-index: 1000;
    overflow: hidden;
    pointer-events: none;
}

.preview-tooltip.show {
    opacity: 1;
    visibility: visible;
}

.preview-tooltip img {
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
    object-fit: cover;
}
```

```javascript:assets/style-3.js
// Add this to your existing JS file
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
    const hoverElements = document.querySelectorAll('.js-hover-preview');
    
    hoverElements.forEach(element => {
        const tooltip = document.createElement('div');
        tooltip.className = 'preview-tooltip';
        tooltip.innerHTML = `<img src="${element.dataset.image}" alt="${element.dataset.alt || 'Preview'}">`;
        document.body.appendChild(tooltip);
        
        element.addEventListener('mouseenter', function(e) {
            const rect = element.getBoundingClientRect();
            tooltip.style.left = rect.left + (rect.width / 2) - 100 + 'px';
            tooltip.style.top = rect.top - 210 + 'px';
            tooltip.classList.add('show');
        });
        
        element.addEventListener('mouseleave', function() {
            tooltip.classList.remove('show');
        });
    });
});
```

**JavaScript HTML:**
```html
<span class="js-hover-preview" data-image="images/stanford.jpg" data-alt="Stanford Campus">
    Stanford
</span>
```

## My Recommendation for Your Use Case:
For your website, I'd suggest **Option 1** (Pure CSS) because it's:
- Simple and lightweight
- No JavaScript required
- Smooth animations
- Works on all devices

You could implement it like this in your existing text:
```html
Hi ü§ù I am Rahul, I am currently a grad student at 
<span class="hover-preview text-red-700">
    Stanford
    <img src="images/stanford-campus.jpg" alt="Stanford Campus" class="preview-image">
</span> üå≤ and an intern at 
<span class="hover-preview nvidia-text">
    NVIDIA Research
    <img src="images/nvidia-hq.jpg" alt="NVIDIA Research" class="preview-image">
</span>
```

Would you like me to help you implement one of these options? And do you have any specific images you'd like to use for the previews?

---

_**User**_

also how do I show the user that this will give u a  preview in a subtle way 

so basically right now I already have href links for some things which are for info like the profile of the people I worked with or labs but those are normal links this is like an img link 

What are my options? 
make the text bold? or what? 

---

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user wants to differentiate between regular links (that take you to another page) and hover preview links (that show an image on hover) in a subtle way. They want users to know that hovering will show a preview rather than clicking to navigate. Let me think of subtle visual cues that would indicate this difference.

Options could be:
1. Different styling (bold, italic, underline style)
2. Small icons or symbols
3. Different colors
4. Different cursor behavior
5. Subtle animations
6. Text decoration differences
7. Small visual indicators

The key is to make it subtle but clear that this is a different type of interaction.</details></think>

---

Great question! You want to subtly indicate that these are "hover preview" links vs "navigation" links. Here are your options from most subtle to more obvious:

## Option 1: Subtle Styling Differences
```css:assets/style-3.css
/* Regular navigation links (your existing ones) */
.in-text {
    color: #007bff;
    text-decoration: underline;
    cursor: pointer;
}

/* Preview hover links - slightly different styling */
.hover-preview {
    position: relative;
    color: #28a745; /* Slightly different color */
    text-decoration: underline;
    text-decoration-style: dotted; /* Dotted underline instead of solid */
    cursor: help; /* Changes cursor to help icon */
    font-weight: 500; /* Slightly bolder */
}
```

## Option 2: Tiny Icon Indicators
```css:assets/style-3.css
.hover-preview::after {
    content: "üñºÔ∏è"; /* or "üëÅÔ∏è" or "üì∑" */
    font-size: 0.7em;
    margin-left: 2px;
    opacity: 0.6;
}

/* Or use FontAwesome icons */
.hover-preview::after {
    content: "\f03e"; /* FontAwesome image icon */
    font-family: "Font Awesome 6 Free";
    font-weight: 900;
    font-size: 0.8em;
    margin-left: 3px;
    opacity: 0.7;
}
```

## Option 3: Subtle Animation Hint
```css:assets/style-3.css
.hover-preview {
    position: relative;
    color: #6f42c1;
    text-decoration: underline;
    text-decoration-style: dashed;
    cursor: help;
    transition: all 0.2s ease;
}

.hover-preview:hover {
    transform: translateY(-1px); /* Subtle lift effect */
    text-shadow: 0 2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);
}

/* Subtle pulsing effect to hint at interactivity */
.hover-preview::before {
    content: "";
    position: absolute;
    top: -2px;
    left: -2px;
    right: -2px;
    bottom: -2px;
    background: rgba(111, 66, 193, 0.1);
    border-radius: 3px;
    opacity: 0;
    animation: subtle-pulse 3s ease-in-out infinite;
}

@keyframes subtle-pulse {
    0%, 100% { opacity: 0; }
    50% { opacity: 0.3; }
}
```

## Option 4: My Recommended Approach - Minimal & Clear
```css:assets/style-3.css
/* Regular navigation links */
.in-text {
    color: #007bff;
    text-decoration: underline;
    cursor: pointer;
}

.in-text:hover {
    color: #0056b3;
}

/* Preview links - distinct but subtle */
.hover-preview {
    position: relative;
    color: #17a2b8; /* Info color - suggests "information" */
    text-decoration: underline;
    text-decoration-style: dotted; /* Dotted = different interaction */
    cursor: help; /* Help cursor hints at hover behavior */
    font-weight: 500;
    transition: all 0.2s ease;
}

.hover-preview:hover {
    color: #138496;
    text-decoration-style: solid;
}

/* Very subtle indicator */
.hover-preview::after {
    content: "‚ìò"; /* Info symbol */
    font-size: 0.7em;
    margin-left: 2px;
    opacity: 0.5;
    transition: opacity 0.2s ease;
}

.hover-preview:hover::after {
    opacity: 0.8;
}
```

## Option 5: Different Approach - Bracket Notation
```css:assets/style-3.css
.hover-preview {
    position: relative;
    color: #6c757d;
    cursor: help;
    font-style: italic;
}

.hover-preview::before {
    content: "[";
    opacity: 0.6;
}

.hover-preview::after {
    content: "]";
    opacity: 0.6;
}
```

## Example Implementation:
```html
Hi ü§ù I am Rahul, I am currently a grad student at 
<span class="hover-preview text-red-700">Stanford</span> üå≤ 
and an intern at 
<span class="hover-preview nvidia-text">NVIDIA Research</span> 
working on post-training for Nemotron LLMs. Before this I worked as a Research Fellow at 
<span class="hover-preview microsoft-text">Microsoft Research</span> 
with 
<a class="in-text" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/yprabhu/" target="_blank">Yashoteja Prabhu</a>
& 
<a class="in-text" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/manik/" target="_blank">Manik Verma</a>
```

## My Top Recommendation:
**Option 4** because it:
- Uses `cursor: help` (most important - changes cursor to indicate hover behavior)
- Dotted underline (visually different from solid underlines)
- Subtle info symbol (‚ìò) that's barely noticeable but hints at "more info"
- Different color to distinguish from navigation links

The key insight is that users will quickly learn: **dotted underline + help cursor = hover for preview**, while **solid underline + pointer cursor = click to navigate**.

Which approach feels right for your site's aesthetic?

_**User**_

okay I added color and font-weight in style-3.css but it doesnt affect what did I do wrong

---

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user says they added color and font-weight to their CSS file but it's not working. Let me think about common issues:

1. They might not have the correct class names in their HTML
2. There might be CSS specificity issues 
3. They might not have saved the CSS file
4. Browser cache might be preventing the changes from showing
5. There might be typos in the CSS
6. The HTML might not be using the right class names

Let me ask to see what they actually added and check their current HTML to see if the class names match.</details></think>

Let me help you debug this! There are a few common reasons why CSS changes don't take effect. Let me check what you added:

---

Read file: assets/style-3.css

I see the issue! You added the `color` and `font-weight` properties inside the `.hover-preview .preview-image` selector (which is for the popup image), but they should be in the main `.hover-preview` selector (which is for the text itself).

Here's what happened:
- Line 142: `color: #28a745;` is inside `.preview-image` (the popup)
- Line 143: `font-weight: 500;` is inside `.preview-image` (the popup)

But these properties should affect the text, not the image popup.

**Here's the fix:**

```css:assets/style-3.css
.hover-preview {
    position: relative;
    cursor: help; /* Changed from pointer to help */
    color: #28a745; /* Move color here */
    font-weight: 500; /* Move font-weight here */
    text-decoration: underline;
    text-decoration-style: dotted; /* Make it dotted to distinguish from regular links */
    transition: color 0.2s ease;
}

.hover-preview:hover {
    color: #1e7e34; /* Darker green on hover */
}

.hover-preview .preview-image {
    position: absolute;
    bottom: 100%;
    left: 50%;
    transform: translateX(-50%);
    width: 200px;
    height: 200px;
    object-fit: cover;
    border-radius: 8px;
    box-shadow: 0 8px 25px rgba(0,0,0,0.3);
    opacity: 0;
    visibility: hidden;
    transition: all 0.3s ease;
    z-index: 1000;
    margin-bottom: 10px;
    border: 3px solid white;
}

.hover-preview:hover .preview-image {
    opacity: 1;
    visibility: visible;
    transform: translateX(-50%) translateY(-5px);
}
```

**Also, make sure your HTML is using the right class:**
```html
<span class="hover-preview">Stanford</span>
```

**Common debugging steps:**
1. **Hard refresh**: Ctrl+F5 (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac) to clear browser cache
2. **Check browser dev tools**: Right-click ‚Üí Inspect ‚Üí check if your CSS is being applied
3. **Verify class names match** between HTML and CSS

Try the fix above and let me know if it works!

_**User**_

so I added a preview-image-landscape class and stuff but now the img takes the whole page thing issue what mistake did i make?

---

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user has added a preview-image-landscape class and now the image is taking up the whole page. This sounds like a CSS positioning or sizing issue. Let me check their current CSS file to see what they've added and identify the problem.</details></think>

Read file: assets/style-3.css

I can see the issue! The problem is that your `.preview-image-landscape` is set to `width: 600px` which is way too large for most screens. This is causing the image to overflow and take up the whole page.

Here's the fix:

```css:assets/style-3.css
.hover-preview .preview-image-landscape {
    position: absolute;
    bottom: 100%;
    left: 50%;
    transform: translateX(-50%);
    width: 300px; /* Reduced from 600px */
    height: 200px; /* Adjusted to maintain landscape ratio */
    object-fit: cover;
    border-radius: 8px;
    box-shadow: 0 8px 25px rgba(0,0,0,0.3);
    opacity: 0;
    visibility: hidden;
    transition: all 0.3s ease;
    z-index: 1000;
    margin-bottom: 10px;
    border: 3px solid white;
}

.hover-preview:hover .preview-image-landscape {
    opacity: 1;
    visibility: visible;
    transform: translateX(-50%) translateY(-5px);
}
```

**Key changes:**
- `width: 300px` (down from 600px)
- `height: 200px` (down from 300px to maintain proper landscape ratio)

**Better approach - Responsive sizing:**
```css:assets/style-3.css
.hover-preview .preview-image-landscape {
    position: absolute;
    bottom: 100%;
    left: 50%;
    transform: translateX(-50%);
    width: min(400px, 80vw); /* Never exceeds 80% of viewport width */
    height: 250px;
    object-fit: cover;
    border-radius: 8px;
    box-shadow: 0 8px 25px rgba(0,0,0,0.3);
    opacity: 0;
    visibility: hidden;
    transition: all 0.3s ease;
    z-index: 1000;
    margin-bottom: 10px;
    border: 3px solid white;
}
```

The `min(400px, 80vw)` ensures the image is never wider than 80% of the screen width, preventing the overflow issue.

**Also, check your HTML** - make sure you're using the right structure:
```html
<span class="hover-preview">
    Your Text
    <img src="your-image.jpg" alt="Description" class="preview-image-landscape">
</span>
```

Try this fix and let me know if the image still takes up the whole page!

_**User**_

no what I mean is that the img is shown even before however

---

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Ah, I see! The user is saying that the image is showing up by default (visible on page load) instead of only appearing on hover. This means the CSS opacity and visibility settings aren't working properly to keep the image hidden by default.

Looking at the CSS, the issue is likely that the image is visible by default and the hover states aren't properly hiding it initially. The `.preview-image-landscape` should start with `opacity: 0` and `visibility: hidden`, but something might be overriding this or the CSS isn't being applied correctly.</details></think>

Ah! The image is showing by default instead of being hidden until hover. This means the initial `opacity: 0` and `visibility: hidden` aren't working properly.

This usually happens because:

1. **CSS isn't being applied** - Hard refresh the page (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)

2. **CSS selector issue** - Make sure your HTML structure matches the CSS selector exactly

Let me check your HTML structure. It should look like this:

**Correct HTML:**
```html
<span class="hover-preview">
    Stanford
    <img src="images/your-image.jpg" alt="Stanford" class="preview-image-landscape">
</span>
```

**Wrong HTML (this would show the image always):**
```html
<span class="hover-preview">Stanford</span>
<img src="images/your-image.jpg" alt="Stanford" class="preview-image-landscape">
```

**Quick fix - Add `!important` to force the initial hidden state:**

```css:assets/style-3.css
.hover-preview .preview-image-landscape {
    position: absolute;
    bottom: 100%;
    left: 50%;
    transform: translateX(-50%);
    width: 300px;
    height: 200px;
    object-fit: cover;
    border-radius: 8px;
    box-shadow: 0 8px 25px rgba(0,0,0,0.3);
    opacity: 0 !important; /* Force hidden */
    visibility: hidden !important; /* Force hidden */
    transition: all 0.3s ease;
    z-index: 1000;
    margin-bottom: 10px;
    border: 3px solid white;
}

.hover-preview:hover .preview-image-landscape {
    opacity: 1 !important; /* Force visible on hover */
    visibility: visible !important; /* Force visible on hover */
    transform: translateX(-50%) translateY(-5px);
}
```

**Or try this alternative approach - using `display` instead:**

```css:assets/style-3.css
.hover-preview .preview-image-landscape {
    position: absolute;
    bottom: 100%;
    left: 50%;
    transform: translateX(-50%);
    width: 300px;
    height: 200px;
    object-fit: cover;
    border-radius: 8px;
    box-shadow: 0 8px 25px rgba(0,0,0,0.3);
    display: none; /* Completely hidden */
    transition: all 0.3s ease;
    z-index: 1000;
    margin-bottom: 10px;
    border: 3px solid white;
}

.hover-preview:hover .preview-image-landscape {
    display: block; /* Show on hover */
    transform: translateX(-50%) translateY(-5px);
}
```

Can you show me the HTML where you're using the hover preview? That will help me identify the exact issue.

_**User**_

is this because of .webp?

---

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is asking if the issue with the image showing by default (instead of being hidden until hover) is because of the .webp file format. 

No, the file format (.webp, .jpg, .png, etc.) shouldn't affect CSS display properties like opacity, visibility, or display. The CSS controls whether the element is shown or hidden, regardless of the image format.

.webp is just a modern image format that's supported by most browsers now, but it behaves the same as other image formats when it comes to CSS styling.

The issue is likely still related to:
1. CSS not being applied properly
2. HTML structure not matching the CSS selectors
3. CSS specificity issues
4. Browser caching

I should clarify that .webp format isn't the cause of this issue.</details></think>

No, the `.webp` format shouldn't cause this issue. The image file format (`.webp`, `.jpg`, `.png`, etc.) doesn't affect CSS display properties like `opacity`, `visibility`, or `display`.

`.webp` is just a modern, efficient image format that works the same as other formats when it comes to CSS styling.

The issue is most likely:

1. **CSS not loading/applying** - Try hard refresh (Ctrl+F5)
2. **HTML structure** - The `<img>` needs to be *inside* the `<span>` with `hover-preview` class
3. **CSS specificity** - Another CSS rule might be overriding your styles

**Can you show me your HTML?** Something like:
```html
<!-- Is it like this? -->
<span class="hover-preview">
    Stanford
    <img src="images/stanford.webp" alt="Stanford" class="preview-image-landscape">
</span>

<!-- Or like this? -->
<span class="hover-preview">Stanford</span>
<img src="images/stanford.webp" alt="Stanford" class="preview-image-landscape">
```

**Quick test - try with a regular .jpg image** to rule out any .webp issues:
```html
<span class="hover-preview">
    Stanford
    <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/300x200" alt="Test" class="preview-image-landscape">
</span>
```

**Debug steps:**
1. Right-click the visible image ‚Üí "Inspect Element"  
2. Look at the computed styles in dev tools
3. Check if `opacity: 0` and `visibility: hidden` are actually applied

The `.webp` format is fine - the issue is elsewhere in the CSS/HTML structure.
