# Adding logos and emojis to the site (2025-06-19 07:36Z)

_**User**_

I want to make some changes here to make the site more lively and cool 

One thing I had in mind was like when I say microsoft research I want to have a small logo of it on side, I can place emojis on side but how do I place a logo in the text that I am writing do u get me?

---

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user wants to make their website more lively and cool by adding logos inline with the text. They specifically mention wanting to add a Microsoft Research logo when they mention "Microsoft Research" in their text. They've already placed emojis inline (like üî¥üå≤ for Stanford) but want to know how to place actual logos inline with the text.

Looking at the HTML, I can see they already have some inline styling and links. For example, they have:
- Stanford üî¥üå≤ with emojis
- They mention Microsoft Research with a link but no logo

To add inline logos, they can use small inline images. I should show them how to:
1. Add small logo images inline with the text using <img> tags
2. Style them appropriately to match the text flow
3. Make sure they're properly sized and aligned

Let me look at the current text structure to see where they mention Microsoft Research and how to integrate logos there.</details></think>

I totally get what you mean! You want to add small inline logos next to company/institution names in your text, similar to how you have emojis like üî¥üå≤ next to Stanford. This is a great way to make the site more visually appealing!

You can add inline logos using small `<img>` tags directly in your text. Here's how you can do it:

```html:111:126:index.html
// ... existing content ...
Hi ü§ù I am Rahul, I am currently a grad student at <span class="text-red-700">Stanford</span> üî¥üå≤ and an intern at NVIDIA Research <img src="images/nvidia_logo.png" class="inline-logo" alt="NVIDIA" /> working on post-training for Nemotron LLMs. Before this  
I worked as a Research Fellow at
<a
  class="in-text"
  href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/"
  target="_blank"
  >Microsoft Research</a
> <img src="images/microsoft_research_logo.png" class="inline-logo" alt="Microsoft Research" />
with
<a
  class="in-text"
  href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/yprabhu/"
  target="_blank"
  >Yashoteja Prabhu</a
>
// ... existing content ...
```

You'll also need to add some CSS to style these inline logos properly. Add this to your CSS file or in a `<style>` section:

```css
.inline-logo {
  height: 1.2em; /* Makes it roughly the same height as text */
  width: auto;
  display: inline;
  vertical-align: middle;
  margin: 0 2px; /* Small spacing around the logo */
}
```

Here are some tips for making this work well:

1. **Logo size**: Keep logos small (around 16-20px height) so they don't disrupt the text flow
2. **Logo format**: Use PNG with transparent backgrounds for best results
3. **Placement**: You can place them right after company names or even replace some emojis

For example, you could also add logos for:
- **Stanford**: Small Stanford tree logo
- **NVIDIA**: Their logo 
- **BITS Pilani**: University logo
- **IISC**: Institution logo

Would you like me to help you find the right logo files or adjust the styling further? Also, do you have the logo images ready, or do you need suggestions on where to get them?

_**User**_

ok but how do I make sure it looks correct and not like if I download lets say some company img and then add it will look some shrinked not so good u feel me? What I am saying? How emojis have correct diemnsions 

---

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is asking about how to make sure the inline logos look good and have the right dimensions, similar to how emojis naturally fit in text. They're concerned about downloaded company logos looking shrunken or distorted when placed inline.

This is a great question about maintaining visual quality and consistency. The key issues are:

1. Logos might have different aspect ratios and designs
2. They might not scale well when made small
3. They might look pixelated or distorted
4. They need to match the text baseline and flow

I should provide solutions for:
1. How to properly size and scale logos
2. CSS techniques to make them look crisp
3. Tips on choosing/preparing the right logo files
4. Maybe suggest using icon fonts or SVGs as alternatives
5. Show specific CSS properties that help with alignment and scaling</details></think>

---

Ah yes, I totally get what you mean! Emojis look perfect because they're designed as fonts and scale naturally with text, while company logos can look pixelated, stretched, or just weird when you shrink them down. Here are some solutions:

## Option 1: Use SVG logos (Best Quality)
SVG logos scale perfectly at any size and stay crisp:

```css
.inline-logo {
  height: 1em; /* Matches text height exactly */
  width: auto;
  display: inline-block;
  vertical-align: baseline; /* Aligns with text baseline */
  margin: 0 3px;
  /* This keeps SVGs crisp */
  image-rendering: -webkit-optimize-contrast;
  image-rendering: crisp-edges;
}
```

## Option 2: High-resolution PNGs with proper CSS
If you must use PNG/JPG, get high-res versions (at least 64px height) and use this CSS:

```css
.inline-logo {
  height: 1em;
  width: auto;
  display: inline-block;
  vertical-align: middle;
  margin: 0 3px;
  /* This makes small images look better */
  image-rendering: -webkit-optimize-contrast;
  image-rendering: crisp-edges;
  /* Smooth scaling */
  transform: scale(1);
  backface-visibility: hidden;
}
```

## Option 3: Use Icon Fonts (Like emojis!)
Many companies have icon font versions. For example:
- Use Font Awesome or similar icon libraries
- They scale exactly like emojis
- Always crisp at any size

```html
<i class="fab fa-microsoft" style="color: #00BCF2;"></i>
<i class="fab fa-nvidia" style="color: #76B900;"></i>
```

## Option 4: Create custom emoji-style icons
You can even create your own "emoji" using CSS and simple shapes that represent the companies:

```css
.company-icon {
  display: inline-block;
  width: 1em;
  height: 1em;
  border-radius: 2px;
  margin: 0 3px;
  vertical-align: middle;
}

.microsoft-icon {
  background: linear-gradient(45deg, #F25022 25%, #7FBA00 25%, #7FBA00 50%, #00A4EF 50%, #00A4EF 75%, #FFB900 75%);
}
```

**My recommendation**: Try to find SVG versions of the logos first (many companies provide these in their brand kits), or use icon fonts. They'll look as crisp as emojis!

Want me to help you implement any of these approaches?

_**User**_

how do I add the 

<i class="fab fa-microsoft" style="color: #00BCF2;"></i> thing? 

---

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user wants to know how to add Font Awesome icons to their website. They need to include the Font Awesome library first, and then they can use the icon classes. Let me check if they already have Font Awesome included in their HTML.

Looking at the HTML, I can see they have Bootstrap CSS included, but I don't see Font Awesome included. They'll need to add the Font Awesome CDN link to their head section.</details></think>

---

To use Font Awesome icons like `<i class="fab fa-microsoft">`, you need to first include the Font Awesome library in your HTML. Here's how:

## Step 1: Add Font Awesome to your `<head>` section

---

Read file: index.html

---

Add the Font Awesome CDN link to your `<head>` section, right after your Bootstrap CSS:

```html:35:42:index.html
    <!-- Bootstrap CSS -->
    <link
      rel="stylesheet"
      href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.4.1/css/bootstrap.min.css"
      integrity="sha384-Vkoo8x4CGsO3+Hhxv8T/Q5PaXtkKtu6ug5TOeNV6gBiFeWPGFN9MuhOf23Q9Ifjh"
      crossorigin="anonymous"
    />
    <!-- Font Awesome CSS -->
    <link
      rel="stylesheet"
      href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/6.5.0/css/all.min.css"
      integrity="sha512-Avb2QiuDEEvB4bZJYdft2mNjVShBftLdPG8FJ0V7irTLQ8Uo0qcPxh4Plq7G5tGm0rU+1SPhVotteLpBERwTkw=="
      crossorigin="anonymous"
      referrerpolicy="no-referrer"
    />
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="assets/style-3.css" />
```

## Step 2: Now you can use the icons in your text

```html:115:125:index.html
// ... existing code ...
Hi ü§ù I am Rahul, I am currently a grad student at <span class="text-red-700">Stanford</span> üî¥üå≤ and an intern at NVIDIA Research <i class="fas fa-microchip" style="color: #76B900;"></i> working on post-training for Nemotron LLMs. Before this  
I worked as a Research Fellow at
<a
  class="in-text"
  href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/"
  target="_blank"
  >Microsoft Research</a
> <i class="fab fa-microsoft" style="color: #00BCF2;"></i>
with
// ... existing code ...
```

## Popular company icons you can use:
- **Microsoft**: `<i class="fab fa-microsoft" style="color: #00BCF2;"></i>`
- **Google**: `<i class="fab fa-google" style="color: #4285F4;"></i>`
- **GitHub**: `<i class="fab fa-github" style="color: #333;"></i>`  
- **LinkedIn**: `<i class="fab fa-linkedin" style="color: #0077B5;"></i>`
- **NVIDIA**: `<i class="fas fa-microchip" style="color: #76B900;"></i>` (no official NVIDIA icon, but microchip works)

The icons will automatically scale with your text and look crisp like emojis! 

Want me to show you how to add more icons or style them differently?

_**User**_

how do I know what fa options i have?

---

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is asking about what Font Awesome icons are available. I can see in their current file that they have an incomplete icon class `class="fas fa-"` so they need to know what options they have for Font Awesome icons.

I should explain how to find Font Awesome icons and give them some popular options for companies and tech-related icons that would be relevant to their site.</details></think>

---

Great question! Here are the ways to find Font Awesome icons:

## Option 1: Browse the Font Awesome website
Go to **https://fontawesome.com/icons** and you can:
- Search for specific companies (like "microsoft", "google", "nvidia")
- Browse by categories (brands, solid, regular)
- See the exact class names to use

## Option 2: Here are popular icons for your use case:

### **Company/Brand Icons** (use `fab` - Font Awesome Brands):
```html
<i class="fab fa-microsoft"></i>        <!-- Microsoft -->
<i class="fab fa-google"></i>           <!-- Google -->
<i class="fab fa-github"></i>           <!-- GitHub -->
<i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i>         <!-- LinkedIn -->
<i class="fab fa-apple"></i>            <!-- Apple -->
<i class="fab fa-amazon"></i>           <!-- Amazon -->
<i class="fab fa-meta"></i>             <!-- Meta/Facebook -->
<i class="fab fa-twitter"></i>          <!-- Twitter -->
<i class="fab fa-instagram"></i>        <!-- Instagram -->
<i class="fab fa-youtube"></i>          <!-- YouTube -->
```

### **Tech/Academic Icons** (use `fas` - Font Awesome Solid):
```html
<i class="fas fa-microchip"></i>        <!-- For NVIDIA/chips -->
<i class="fas fa-graduation-cap"></i>   <!-- For universities -->
<i class="fas fa-building"></i>         <!-- For institutions -->
<i class="fas fa-flask"></i>            <!-- For research -->
<i class="fas fa-robot"></i>            <!-- For AI/robotics -->
<i class="fas fa-brain"></i>            <!-- For AI/ML -->
<i class="fas fa-code"></i>             <!-- For programming -->
<i class="fas fa-university"></i>       <!-- For academic institutions -->
```

## Option 3: Search by keyword
On the Font Awesome site, try searching for:
- "research" - gives you research-related icons
- "tech" - gives you technology icons  
- "university" - gives you academic icons
- Company names like "stanford", "nvidia", etc.

## For your current NVIDIA icon:
Since there's no official NVIDIA icon, complete it with:
```html
<i class="fas fa-microchip" style="color: #76B900;"></i>
```

Or you could use:
```html
<i class="fas fa-robot" style="color: #76B900;"></i>    <!-- For AI focus -->
<i class="fas fa-brain" style="color: #76B900;"></i>    <!-- For AI/ML -->
```

The website will show you exactly which class to use - just copy and paste! Want me to suggest specific icons for Stanford, IISC, BITS Pilani, etc.?

oksy so the fontawesome dont really have the options I want is there a way to make an img into it or something the way we do with favicon or somethijg

---

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is asking how to use custom images like company logos as icons instead of Font Awesome, similar to how favicons work. They want to integrate custom images into their text that look good and scale properly like emojis or Font Awesome icons.

I should show them how to:
1. Use small custom images with proper CSS styling
2. Make them look crisp and scale properly
3. Position them inline with text like emojis
4. Give tips on image formats and sizing

They're currently trying to add logos for companies that don't have Font Awesome icons, so custom images would be the best solution.</details></think>

---

Absolutely! You can use custom images (like company logos) as inline icons. Here's how to do it properly:

## Method 1: Small Custom Logo Images

First, you'll need small logo images. Save them in your `images/` folder (like `images/nvidia_logo.png`, `images/stanford_logo.png`, etc.).

```html:126:132:index.html
Hi ü§ù I am Rahul, I am currently a grad student at <span class="text-red-700">Stanford</span> <img src="images/stanford_logo.png" class="inline-icon" alt="Stanford" /> and an intern at NVIDIA Research <img src="images/nvidia_logo.png" class="inline-icon" alt="NVIDIA" /> working on post-training for Nemotron LLMs. Before this  
I worked as a Research Fellow at
<a
  class="in-text"
  href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/"
  target="_blank"
  >Microsoft Research</a
> <img src="images/microsoft_logo.png" class="inline-icon" alt="Microsoft" />
```

## Add this CSS to make them look perfect:

---

Read file: assets/style-3.css

---

Add this CSS to your `assets/style-3.css` file:

```css
.inline-icon {
    height: 1.1em; /* Slightly bigger than text height */
    width: auto;
    display: inline-block;
    vertical-align: middle;
    margin: 0 3px; /* Small spacing around icon */
    /* Make images crisp */
    image-rendering: -webkit-optimize-contrast;
    image-rendering: crisp-edges;
    /* Optional: add subtle effects */
    opacity: 0.9;
    transition: opacity 0.2s ease;
}

.inline-icon:hover {
    opacity: 1;
}
```

## Tips for getting the best logo images:

1. **Download from official brand kits**: Most companies have press/media kits with high-quality logos
   - Microsoft: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/intellectualproperty/trademarks
   - NVIDIA: Look for their brand guidelines
   - Stanford: Their media resources page

2. **Image specs**:
   - **Format**: PNG with transparent background (best)
   - **Size**: At least 64px height for crisp scaling
   - **Style**: Simple, clean logos work best at small sizes

3. **Quick sources**:
   - **Brandfetch.com** - has most company logos
   - **LogoEPS.com** - free logo downloads
   - **Wikipedia** - often has clean logo files

4. **Alternative**: You can even create simple geometric shapes as "logos":

```css
.custom-logo {
    display: inline-block;
    width: 1em;
    height: 1em;
    border-radius: 2px;
    margin: 0 3px;
    vertical-align: middle;
}

.nvidia-logo {
    background: #76B900;
    /* Add a simple 'N' or keep it as a colored square */
}
```

Want me to help you find specific logos or create simple custom ones?

_**User**_

I tried what u recommended but the img is too big like takes up half the page rather than being small why? 

---

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is experiencing an issue where the inline icon image is showing up too big - taking up half the page instead of being small like text. This is happening because:

1. They haven't added the CSS I recommended yet, or
2. The original image file is very large and without proper CSS constraints, it's displaying at full size
3. The CSS class "inline-icon" isn't defined yet

I need to help them add the CSS to make the image small and properly sized. Let me check their CSS file and then provide the solution.</details></think>

---

Ah! The image is showing at its full size because you haven't added the CSS styling yet. The `inline-icon` class doesn't exist in your CSS file, so the browser is just showing the image at its original size.

You need to add the CSS I mentioned earlier. Let me help you add it to your `assets/style-3.css` file:

```css
.inline-icon {
    height: 1.1em; /* This makes it roughly the same height as text */
    width: auto;
    display: inline-block;
    vertical-align: middle;
    margin: 0 3px;
    /* Make images crisp */
    image-rendering: -webkit-optimize-contrast;
    image-rendering: crisp-edges;
    /* Optional: add subtle effects */
    opacity: 0.9;
    transition: opacity 0.2s ease;
}

.inline-icon:hover {
    opacity: 1;
}
```

Add this CSS to the end of your `assets/style-3.css` file. The key part is `height: 1.1em` - this constrains the image to be roughly the same height as your text.

**Alternative quick fix**: You can also add the styling directly in your HTML for now:

```html:126:126:index.html
Hi ü§ù I am Rahul, I am currently a grad student at <span class="text-red-700">Stanford</span> üå≤ and an intern at NVIDIA Research <img src="images/nvidia_logo.png" style="height: 1.1em; width: auto; vertical-align: middle; margin: 0 3px;" alt="NVIDIA" />  working on post-training for Nemotron LLMs. Before this
```

The `height: 1.1em` is what makes it small - `em` units are relative to the text size, so `1.1em` means "slightly bigger than the text height". 

Try adding either the CSS file update or the inline style, and your logo should shrink down to the right size!

_**User**_

in my style-3.css I added incline icon?

---

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is asking about the inline-icon CSS they added to their style-3.css file. Looking at the attached file, I can see they have indeed added the .inline-icon CSS class at the end of the file (lines 83-97). The CSS looks correct:

```css
.inline-icon {
    height: 1.1em; /* Slightly bigger than text height */
    width: auto;
    display: inline-block;
    vertical-align: middle;
    margin: 0 3px; /* Small spacing around icon */
    /* Make images crisp */
    image-rendering: -webkit-optimize-contrast;
    image-rendering: crisp-edges;
    /* Optional: add subtle effects */
    opacity: 0.9;
    transition: opacity 0.2s ease;
}

.inline-icon:hover {
    opacity: 1;
}
```

So the CSS is there and should work. If the image is still too big, there might be a few reasons:

1. The CSS file might not be loading/refreshing properly
2. There might be some caching issues
3. The image file itself might be corrupted or too large
4. There might be other CSS overriding this

I should help them troubleshoot this.</details></think>

---

Yes, I can see you've added the `.inline-icon` CSS correctly to your `style-3.css` file! The CSS looks perfect and should make the image small.

If the image is still showing up big, here are a few things to check:

## 1. **Browser Cache Issue**
Try refreshing your browser with a hard refresh:
- **Chrome/Firefox**: `Ctrl+F5` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)
- Or open Developer Tools (F12) and right-click the refresh button ‚Üí "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"

## 2. **Check if CSS is loading**
Open your browser's Developer Tools (F12) and:
- Go to the **Elements** tab
- Find your `<img>` tag with `class="inline-icon"`
- Check if the CSS styles are applied in the right panel

## 3. **Try with inline styles temporarily**
To test if it's a CSS loading issue, try this temporarily:

```html:126:126:index.html
Hi ü§ù I am Rahul, I am currently a grad student at <span class="text-red-700">Stanford</span> üå≤ and an intern at NVIDIA Research <img src="images/nvidia_logo.png" style="height: 1.1em !important; width: auto !important; vertical-align: middle !important;" alt="NVIDIA" />  working on post-training for Nemotron LLMs. Before this
```

The `!important` will override any conflicting styles.

## 4. **Check the image file**
Make sure your `images/nvidia_logo.png` file isn't corrupted. If you're still having issues, try with a different small image first to test.

Which method works for you? If none of these work, let me know and we can debug further!
