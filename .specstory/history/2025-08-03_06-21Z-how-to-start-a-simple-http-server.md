_**Assistant**_

I can help you start a simple HTTP server using Python 3. There are two common ways to do this:

1. Using Python's built-in `http.server` module (simplest method):
```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

2. Or if you want to specify a different port:
```bash
python3 -m http.server <port_number>
```

After running either command:
- The server will start and serve files from your current directory
- You can access your website by opening a web browser and navigating to:
  - `http://localhost:8000` or
  - `http://127.0.0.1:8000`

Since you're in the `rahulschand.github.io` directory, this will serve your website locally and you'll be able to see your `index.html` and other files through the browser.

To stop the server, simply press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal.

Note: This server is meant for development/testing purposes only and shouldn't be used in production environments as it's not secure or performance-optimized.
